# Plant-disease-classifier
This is a plant disease classifier for Potato as well as Tomato plants.
Here i have used over 16,000 images to train a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify various diseases that the plant can have.
Do keep in mind that i have only trained it to classify based on images from the leaf of the plant.
The full list of diseases that my model can classify are:
1. Potato: Early Blight, Late Blight
2. Tomato: Target Spot, mosaic virus, Yellow leaf curl virus, Bacterial spot, Early blight, Late blight, Leaf mold, Septoria leaf spot, two spotted spider mites
